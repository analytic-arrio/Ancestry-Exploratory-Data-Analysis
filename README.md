# Ancestry-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
EDA for Ancestry

This project is available for those who wish to see how I analyzed a large dataset (>250k rows) of data from Ancestry on customers who purchase subscription products.

### Required Libraries

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
itertools
```

NOTE: This project only runs on Python 3

## Getting Started

Simply run ancestry_acom_exploratory_data_analysis.py. The file already contains the required filepath, so there is no need to obtain the data set separately.
